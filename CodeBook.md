This code book describes the variables, and the transformations performed to clean up the data. The raw data has been downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip The resulting processed data is located in the final_data.txt file, a text file with the variable names and space-separated values. Transformation operations follow instructions available in run_analysis.R script

Variables
activity identifies 6 activity labels that may be performed by a subject:
